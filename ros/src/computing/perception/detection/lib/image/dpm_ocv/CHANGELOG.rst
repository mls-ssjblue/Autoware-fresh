1.0.0 (2016-12-22)
------------------
* Fix for rosjava installed platform
  Some packages don't declare package dependencies correctly.
  This makes message jar files built failure.
* Always check return value from CUDA API
* Correct wrong type name
* Add CUDA_CHECK after memory accesses
* Remove extra level of indirection from cuMemFreeHost
  cuda-memcheck complained about a failure to free, and no doubt the memory leak would soon lead to more problems.
* Need one more convStream element
  The loop starting at 493 is off-by-one without it, as are lines 568 and 569.
  Furthermore, if it so happens that the model has lots of parts but few levels (ie a small Î») such that parts ("n" here) is more than two greater than the HOG pyramid levels ("numLevels"), line 580 will overflow. This is TODO, but a higher priority IMO is to redesign the use of streams and texture memory, as texMap prevents parallelisation of part map processing.
* Fix off-by-one error
  cuda-memcheck reported an out-of-bounds read here, which would be followed by an out-of-bounds write. I think changing from <= to < is sufficient.
* Improve cmake CUDA configuration
  Use cmake CUDA feature as possible for removing absolute paths.
* Use c++11 option instead of c++0x
  We can use newer compilers which support 'c++11' option
* Use modified OpenCV function for adjusting parameter
* Update dpm_ocv
  - support using both GPU and CPU
  - clean up code
